# Environment variables (optional)

# Note: API keys are now stored in browser localStorage by default.
# Users will be prompted to enter their API key when first using the app.
#
# If you prefer to use environment variables instead (for development),
# you can uncomment and set these:

# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
